### Our Workflow

#### Day 1
* We were not known the detail rule, so spent comfortably while studying on the functional programming during the first few hours.
* One of our members wrote up the interpreter of the galaxy in half a day! It's great!
* Discovered some drawings from the galaxy. Huh?

#### Day 2
* We almost understood tutorials.
* One of our members wrote up the Galaxy Pad using the Node.js in a few hours. Marvelous!
* And then, we played games on the Galaxy Pad during a several hours. It was fun!

#### Day 3
* We analyzed game systems, protocols, parameters.
* We thought deeply about strategies of the final tournament and wrote their programs.

This contest was one of the best ICFP Programming Contests, and so we had good time in this period.
Thank you so much, the organizers!

## Memo

```
In the next 7 days, we kindly ask you to do the following:

Make your repository (specified in the team profile) public. We've obfuscated your email in the profile so don't be afraid to leak your API key. Don't forget to commit your “galaxy evaluator” (or “Galaxy Pad”), if any, to the repository. Add a README, share your experience, pictures, videos, and write-ups. Definitely do so, if you wish your team to be considered for a prize.

Optionally, leave feedback (the link will appear right here.)
```
